## ‚ú® Features
- Follows the conventional commit guidelines
- Highly flexible configuration
- Easy install with sane defaults
- Checks git status with interactive git add
- Works globally or in your repository
- Attempts to infer ticket/issue and type from branch
- Pretty prints preview in color
- Validates config at runtime

## üì¶ Installation
 
```sh
npm install -g better-commits
```

## üöÄ Usage

When you're ready to commit. To run the CLI in your terminal:

```sh
better-commits
# or
npx better-commits
```

It will prompt a series of questions. These prompts will build a commit message, which you can preview, before confirming the commit.

To better understand these prompts and their intention, read [Conventional Commits Summary](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary)

To modify, these prompts, see `configuration`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
 
 
### Global

Your first time running `better-commits`, a default config will be generated in your `$HOME` directory, named `.better-commits.json`
- This config will be used if a repository-specific config cannot be found.

### Repository

To create a **repository-specific config**, navigate to the root of your project.
- run `better-commits-init`
- This will create a default config named `.better-commits.json`

All properties are optional, they can be removed from your configuration and will be replaced by the defaults at run-time.

### Defaults

```json
{
	"check_status": true,
	"commit_type": {
		"enable": true,
		"initial_value": "feat",
		"infer_type_from_branch": true,
		"options": [
			{
				"value": "feat",
				"label": "feat",
				"hint": "A new feature"
			},
			{
				"value": "fix",
				"label": "fix",
				"hint": "A bug fix"
			},
			{
				"value": "docs",
				"label": "docs",
				"hint": "Documentation only changes"
			},
			{
				"value": "refactor",
				"label": "refactor",
				"hint": "A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature"
			},
			{
				"value": "perf",
				"label": "perf",
				"hint": "A code change that improves performance"
			},
			{
				"value": "test",

			}
		]
	},
	"commit_scope": {

			}
		]
	},
	"check_ticket": {
		"infer_ticket": true,
		"confirm_ticket": true,
		"add_to_title": true,
		"append_hashtag": false
	},
	"commit_title": {
		"max_size": 70
	},
	"commit_body": {
		"enable": true,
		"required": false
	},
	"commit_footer": {
		"enable": true,
		"initial_value": [],
		"options": [
			"closes",
			"breaking-change",
			"deprecated",
			"custom"
		]
	},
	"breaking_change": {
		"add_exclamation_to_title": true
	},
	"confirm_commit": true,
	"print_commit_output": true
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Config Validation
To simplify the CLI, some rules are enforced at runtime to make sure the program runs properly.
- any property can be removed from the config, it will be replaced by the default at run-time
- if a property is a string/number/boolean in the default, it must stay that type
- the `initial_value` must be a valid value in the corresponding `options`
- `commit_scope` and `commit_type` can be populated with as many or whatever options
  - must maintain the shape `{value: string, label?: string, hint?: string}`
  - `hint` and `label` are optional
  - to force scope or type to be required, remove `None`
- `commit_footer` options are supplied from a fixed list, because they have specific functionality
  - thus, you can remove from that list, but you can't add custom values to it

TODO: Add table explaining properties

#### üîé Inference

`better-commits` will attempt to infer the ticket/issue and the type from your branch name. It will auto populate the corresponding field if found. 

**Ticket**
- `STRING-NUMBER` -- If a string-number is at the start of the branch
- `/STRING-NUMBER` -- If a string-number comes after a /

**Issue**
- `NUMBER` -- If a number is at the start of the branch
- `/NUMBER` -- If a number comes after a /

**Type**
- `TYPE-` -- If a type is at the start of the branch
- `TYPE/` -- If a slash comes after the type
- `-TYPE-` -- If a type is between two dashes

## üòÆ Mildly Interesting
- `better-commits` works with [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
- if you use `better-commits` to create your *first* commit on a new branch, when you open a PR for that branch, it will properly **auto-populate the title and body**.
- when you squash / merge with github, if `better-commits` is your *first* commit, all later commits like "addressing comments", "fixing mistake". Will be prefixed with an asterisk for easy deletion. This way you **maintain your pretty commit even when squashing**.
- if you use a branch name like the ones below, better-commits will be able to infer your ticket/issue and type
  - `TYPE/TICKET-description`
  - `USER/TYPE/TICKET-description`
- if you're using Github issues to track your work, and select the `closes` footer option when writing your commit. Github will **automatically link and close** that issue when your **pr is merged**
- [better-commits](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=better-commits) is much smaller than its alternative [commitizen](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=commitizen)
- `better-commits` uses native `git` commands under the hood. So any hooks, tools, or staging should work as if it was a normal commit.
- You can add this badge to your repository to display that you're using a better-commits repository config

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

`TTY initialization failed: uv_tty_init returned EBADF (bad file descriptor)`. This may happen because you're running something like git-bash on Windows. Try another terminal/command-prompt or `winpty` to see if its still an issue.

## Alternatives
