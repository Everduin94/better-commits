A CLI for writing better commits, following the conventional commit guidelines	
</p>

https://github.com/Everduin94/better-commits/assets/14320878/842533de-b794-498a-9f7a-8a70de283553


## ‚ú® Features
- Follows the conventional commit guidelines
- Highly flexible configuration with sane defaults
- Infers ticket/issue and commit-type from branch
- Consistent branch naming CLI via `better-branch`
- Checks git status with interactive git add
- Works globally or in your repository
- Pretty prints preview in color
- Support for git emojis per commit-type
- Config validation with specific error messages

## üì¶ Installation
 
```sh
npm install -g better-commits
```

## üöÄ Usage

When you're ready to commit. To run the CLI in your terminal:

```sh
better-commits
# or
npx better-commits
```

It will prompt a series of questions. These prompts will build a commit message, which you can preview, before confirming the commit.

To better understand these prompts and their intention, read [Conventional Commits Summary](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary)

To modify, these prompts, see `configuration`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
 
### Global

Your first time running `better-commits`, a default config will be generated in your `$HOME` directory, named `.better-commits.json`
- This config will be used if a repository-specific config cannot be found.

### Repository

To create a **repository-specific config**, navigate to the root of your project.
- run `better-commits-init`
- This will create a default config named `.better-commits.json`

All properties are optional, they can be removed from your configuration and will be replaced by the defaults at run-time.

### Defaults

Any property can be removed from the config, it will be replaced by the default at run-time
- See `.better-commits.json` in this repository as an example

### üîé Inference

`better-commits` will attempt to infer the ticket/issue and the commit-type from your branch name. It will auto populate the corresponding field if found. 

**Ticket / Issue-Number** 
- If a `STRING-NUMBER` or `NUMBER` are at the start of the branch name or after a `/`

**Commit Type**
- If a type is at the start of the branch or is followed by a `/`

## üå≥ Better Branch

Better branch is a secondary feature that works with better commits
- Caches your username
- Uses same type-list/prompt from your config
- Formats branch name

To run the CLI in your terminal:

```sh
better-branch
```

### Pre/Post Branch Checkout Hooks

Optionally configure pre and post checkout commands, for example:
- checkout and rebase main before branching
- run `npm install` before branching
- run `npm run dev` after branching

See *branch_pre_commands* and *branch_post_commands* in default config.

## üåå Mildly Interesting

### Building / Versioning
`better-commits` works with [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
- See *package.json* and *.github/workflows/publish.yml* for example

### Github
if you use `better-commits` to create your *first* commit on a new branch
- when you open a PR for that branch, it will properly **auto-populate the title and body**.
- when you squash/merge, all later commits like "addressing comments" or "fixing mistake". Will be prefixed with an asterisk for easy deletion. This way, you **maintain your pretty commit even when squashing**.

if you're using Github issues to track your work, and select the `closes` footer option when writing your commit. Github will **automatically link and close** that issue when your **pr is merged**

### Fun Facts
[better-commits](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=better-commits) is much smaller than its alternative [commitizen](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=commitizen)

`better-commits` uses native `git` commands under the hood. So any hooks, tools, or staging should work as if it was a normal commit.

You can add this badge to your repository to display that you're using a better-commits repository config

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

`TTY initialization failed: uv_tty_init returned EBADF (bad file descriptor)`. This may happen because you're running something like git-bash on Windows. Try another terminal/command-prompt or `winpty` to see if its still an issue.

If your are having issues with multilines for commits on windows, you can override the shell via config.

Example.
```
"overrides": {
   "shell": "c:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
}
```
